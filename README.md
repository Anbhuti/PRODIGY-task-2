# PRODIGY-task-2

**📌 Project Overview**  This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns, trends, and relationships among variables that influenced passenger survival.  This task was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech (Task-02).

**📂 Dataset**

Dataset Name: Titanic Dataset

Source: Kaggle / Prodigy InfoTech GitHub

Description:
The dataset contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, family size, and survival status.

**🛠 Tools & Technologies Used**

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

**🔍 Steps Performed**

Loaded and explored the dataset

Handled missing values (data cleaning)

Performed univariate and bivariate analysis

Visualized survival distribution

Analyzed survival based on:

Gender

Passenger Class

Created a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between numerical features

**📈 Visualizations Included**

Survival Count Plot

Survival by Gender

Survival by Passenger Class

Correlation Heatmap

**📊 Key Insights**

Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males

Passengers in 1st class had better survival chances

Passenger class and fare showed significant correlation with survival
